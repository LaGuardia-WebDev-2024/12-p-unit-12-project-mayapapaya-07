        Even though I don't remember this birthday, whenever I see this photo I feel like I remember it. I don't think I have ever seen mami happier or prettier than in this photo (she looks like a barbie princess!), and I can really feel the love of my family.

        <h3 id="mem2">Posing in a tutu with Meowzers</h3>
        <p class="meowz" style="display:none">
        I was around 8 or 9 when I got my cat Mieko, but I always just called her 'Meowzers'. I was wearing a tutu from ballet class and holding my cat which I can't really do anymore since she's a fussy teenager. I'm usually wearing a tutu in most of my baby pictures for some reason. I find this photo so cute, because we are both babies and it shows how much we have grown up together. 
        </p>

      Jalen in my baby brother, and right jnow he's 2 years old. I like to think he was praying in his sleep, and giving thanks for the yummy milk.
